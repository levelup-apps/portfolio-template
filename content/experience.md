# Experience

## Microsoft
**Software Engineering Intern** | May 2024 – Aug 2024

I returned to working with the Advanced Autonomy and Applied Robotics team, part of the Strategic Missions and Technology (SMT) OCTO group, which focuses on human-machine-AI teaming. During my internship, I developed Agents4Robots, a framework to build AI agents that control specific robot's movements using advanced LLMs and developer-provided tools.

**Software Engineering Intern** | May 2023 – Aug 2023

I worked with the Advanced Autonomy and Applied Robotics team in the Strategic Missions and Technology division. I developed an application on the Microsoft Teams Plugin platform, enabling users to remotely operate robots.

## Uber Inc.
**UberSTAR SWE Internship** | May 2022 – Aug 2022

Interned with Uber's Enterprise Billing team, which helps manage B2B transactions with Uber's partners (Walmart, Apple, Drizly, etc.). My project was a series of API endpoints serialized into the Google Protobuf format to query and sort through all billing invoices.

## Research Intern
**Agroecosystem Sustainability Center** | Jan 2023 – present

I am a part of the lab of Professor Kaiyu Guan, who is the Director of the Agroecosystem Sustainability Center and is affiliated with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. In our research, we utilize satellite data, computational models, and machine learning techniques to develop more productive and sustainable crop practices. Last spring, I developed an online portal for local farmers, enabling them to access their own crop data and analyze soil moisture data over time. To create this portal, I used Next.JS, Google APIs for integrated maps and plots, and hosted the data on MongoDB. This semester, I am collaborating with Assistant Professor Bin Peng, two Colombian social scientists, and the NASA LCLUC project to map rural croplands in Colombia.
